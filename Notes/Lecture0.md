#### Goal of CS106L

1.Learn what features are out there in C++ and why

2.Become comfortable with reading C++ documentation

3.Become familiar with the design philosophy of morden C++

NOT: memorize the syntax of C++



#### Road Map of the Course

C++ Fundamentals -> Standard Template Library -> Object-Oriented Programming -> Morden C++



#### The history of C++

- Assembly Language

- The inverntion of C

  Weakness: 

  * No objects or classes

  * Difficult to write code that can work generically

  * Tedious when writing large programs

- Evolotion of C++



#### Design Philosophy of C++

* Allow the programmer full control
* Express ideas and  intent directly in code
* Enforce safety at compile time whenever possible
* Do not waste time or space
* Compartmentalize messy constructs
